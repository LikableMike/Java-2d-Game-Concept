# Java-2d-Game-Concept

This was a collaboration project between the Professor and the student.
Our professor provided a "Bare bones" game engine that he wrote and we were in charge of adding programmer art 
along with player movement and object collision/ interaction.

Files I was in charge of writing:
  BoundingBox.Java,
  Entity.Java,
  HashChain.Java,
  HashMap.Java,
  Vector2D.java
  
  
Files I had to build upon to make work
  Main.Java,
  KeyProcessor.Java,
  spriteInfo.Java

P.S: I'm not exactly an artist...
